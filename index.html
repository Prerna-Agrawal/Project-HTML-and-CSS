                           <p>City Palace has stood at the heart of the Old City of Jaipur for nearly three centuries, shortly after Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II decided to relocate his court from the city of Amber. Protected by huge guard walls, the fairy-tale-like structure is still the home of Jaipur's modern-day royal family, and is more extravagant and enchanting than you might imagine.
                               <p>City Palace is more than a sand-colored regal abode—it's a sprawling complex of buildings built around a series of landscaped garden courtyards overlooking Jaipur and Lake Palace. The entire property is a stunning display of Rajasthani and Mughal architecture.</p>

                           <p>At first glance, Jantar Mantar may look to be nothing more than a bunch of larger-than-life abstract sculptures. But this is not an art gallery—it's a special collection of astronomical tools started by Rajput ruler Jai Singh II to measure the heavens nearly 300 years ago.</p>
                               <p>
                                   The observatory's massive sun dial, known as Samrat Yantra, is particularly striking. At 27 meters tall, it casts a huge shadow that accurately measures time down to two seconds.
                               </p>
                               <p>The elaborate Jai Prakash also tracks the passing of time, using the shadow of a metal plate suspended above a sunken bowl-like structure. Other tools at the observatory can track stars and even predict eclipses.</p>

                           <p>Tourists can learn about the history of the sandstone structure at the palace's small museum—the ceremonial armor collection is particularly interesting. You can also wander the narrow hallways that run throughout the palace. Don't miss the colorful glasswork in windows and doorways, which cast an otherworldly glow on chambers throughout Hawal Mahal.</p>
                               
                               <p>The landmark was built in 1799 to allow royal ladies to watch festivals on the street without being seen by the public. Its 953 windows allow plenty of breeze to pass through, making it an ideal summer palace.</p>

                           <p>Jaipur is home to one of India's most-visited forts: Amber Fort. Built in the year 1592, the sandstone and marble monolith stands atop a small hill roughly 20 minute's driving distance northeast of the center of Jaipur. It's best known for being a pristine example of Rajasthani architecture.</p>

                           <p>When English writer Rudyard Kipling visited the Albert Hall Museum in Jaipur, he wrote that it was a "rebuke to all other museums in India from Calcutta downwards." That's high praise coming from the son of a curator, and fitting for this renowned institution.</p>
